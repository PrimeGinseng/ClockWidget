# ClockWidget
A simple clock widget that pulls weather data from the Canadian government's website. Non-extensible, it was designed to suit my specific needs. Uploaded here for reference. Uses System time to display the current time. The purpose of this program was to have a clock on my other screen without adding the entire toolbar, or using resource-intensive programs like Rainmeter.

## Instructions
Requires Python 2.7.1 (yeah, this is old) and wxPython 3.0.2.0.

Replace the WEATHERURL variable with your own city's weather RSS page from the Canadian government's [weather website](https://weather.gc.ca/). Example: For Montreal, the URL is: https://weather.gc.ca/rss/city/qc-147_e.xml
